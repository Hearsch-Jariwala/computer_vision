## Topic: Detecting Violent Content in Social Media Images 

Social media has become a primary mode of consumption for news and current events. Therefore, having a variety of content without description in the age of information, how can we evaluate content specifically for sensitive and violent images? Is there an algorithm that can estimate violence?

This leads to a paper on Implementation of the model used in the paper **_Protest Activity Detection and Perceived Violence Estimation from Social Media Images_** (ACM Multimedia 2017) [\[arxiv\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.06204) *by Donghyeon Won, Zachary C. Steinert-Threlkeld, Jungseock Joo*.

Utilizing this paper's algorithm we added a GRAD-CAM for more interpretability to identify where the algorithm is picking up the violence estimations.
